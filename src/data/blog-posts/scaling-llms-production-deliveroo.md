# Scaling LLMs in Production: Lessons from Deliveroo

## The Challenge of Scale

When we first started experimenting with large language models at Deliveroo, we quickly realized that the jump from prototype to production is significant. What works for a few hundred requests per day doesn't necessarily work for thousands or millions.

The main challenges we encountered were:
- **Latency requirements**: Our users expect fast responses, but LLMs can be slow
- **Cost optimization**: Model inference can get expensive at scale
- **Reliability**: We needed consistent performance even during peak hours
- **Model drift**: Ensuring model performance doesn't degrade over time

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Model Serving Architecture

We experimented with several approaches before settling on our current architecture:

1. **Direct API calls**: Initially, we used third-party APIs directly from our application servers
2. **Caching layer**: We added Redis caching for common queries
3. **Model gateway**: Finally, we built a dedicated service to handle all ML model interactions

The model gateway approach gave us several advantages:
- Centralized monitoring and logging
- Easy A/B testing of different models
- Better cost tracking and optimization
- Simplified fallback mechanisms

### Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring LLMs in production requires different metrics than traditional services:
- **Token usage**: Critical for cost management
- **Response quality**: Using automated evaluation metrics
- **User satisfaction**: Tracking user feedback and engagement
- **Model performance**: Latency, throughput, and error rates

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start Simple

Our first production deployment was overly complex. We tried to optimize everything from day one, which led to unnecessary complexity and bugs. Starting with a simple setup and iterating based on real usage patterns proved much more effective.

### 2. Invest in Evaluation

Building robust evaluation pipelines early is crucial. We learned this the hard way when a model update degraded performance for specific use cases that we hadn't properly tested.

### 3. Cost Monitoring is Essential

LLM costs can spiral quickly. We built detailed cost tracking into our system from the beginning, which helped us identify optimization opportunities and make informed decisions about model selection.

### 4. Plan for Failures

LLMs can fail in unexpected ways. Having proper fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation strategies is essential for maintaining service reliability.

## Looking Forward

As the LLM landscape continues to evolve rapidly, we're focusing on:
- **Multi-model strategies**: Using different models for different tasks
- **Edge deployment**: Moving some models closer to users for better latency
- **Fine-tuning**: Customizing models for our specific use cases
- **Cost optimization**: Continuously improving our cost per request

The key to success with LLMs in production is treating them as part of a larger system, not as magic solutions. Proper engineering practices, monitoring, and gradual rollouts are just as important as choosing the right model.
